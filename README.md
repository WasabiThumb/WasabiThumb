Hello, I'm **Xavier** (classically known under the alias *WasabiThumbs*)! 

You've reached my FOSS dumping ground, where you can find quality parsers, utilities, tools, programs and plugins written by yours truly. I'm currently focused on private projects, but I also contribute to [XClaim v2](https://github.com/WasabiThumb/xclaim/tree/modern) as time permits.

I have a wide range of coding interests and proficiencies, with a preference for strongly typed languages and a soft spot for
Java. I also often use Kotlin, C/C++, Rust, and web technologies like TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and PHP. I embrace modern tooling and frameworks- Gradle over Maven, Tailwind for life, et cetera. *I am insufferable.*

For inquiries, I prefer Discord ([@wasabithumbs](https://discord.com/users/292053354564157441)) over email when possible. If you are reporting
a non-security-critical issue with any of my projects, please create an issue on its associated repository.
